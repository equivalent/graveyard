# History of Linux

My High School final exam software project - History of Linux (CMS)

Project was build in PHP & MySQL in 2007.

The code is :hankey: as this was my first Software experience,
and back then I had no idea what is
git or proper syntax style is or good coding practices are.

But if anyone find this useful feel free to get inspired.
